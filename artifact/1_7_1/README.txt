The roots to all that will be developed...

This project acts as the "roots" of this portfolio: the essentials needed for all other programs.

It is composed of an API of methods that help other projects function in their processes. For example, "Writer" writes any String you want to any file path you want.

Basically, this is my go-to library for development. Feel free to see what I have done in this project to minimize the amount of code I have to write.
